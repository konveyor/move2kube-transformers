# Custom WASM Transformers

These samples show how custom WASM/WASI modules can be run as custom transformers in Move2Kube. The samples are designed for the browser version of Move2Kube. The transformers have been built and zipped for convenience.

You can try these samples out at https://move2kube.konveyor.io/experimental

- The `language-platforms.zip` sample has also been copied here for convenience.
- The `wasm-java-helm-chart.zip` sample is a port of the Starlark transformer https://github.com/konveyor/move2kube-transformers/tree/main/add-custom-files-directories-in-custom-locations to Golang/WASM/WASI
